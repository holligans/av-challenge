# Alexander F. Vazquez's Take-Home Assessment
# Production-Ready Enhancements for the Project

Time was limited after completing the cache library, and I chose not to start a complex configuration that I might not be able to finish, as it could break the project and result in non-working code.

## Enhancements I Would Add

### Core Improvements
- **Switch to Vite**: In a real-world scenario, I would migrate from esbuild to Vite for its superior support for modern development workflows and SSR. However, for now, Iâ€™ll continue using esbuild.
- **Optimize esbuild**:
  - Enable **code splitting**, **compression**, **tree-shaking**, and **cache busting** for the client build.
  - Add **source maps** to improve debugging during development and production.
- **Handle Static Assets**: Ensure esbuild effectively manages static assets, possibly with a plugin.
- **Integrate Linting and Formatting**:
  - Add **ESLint** for consistent linting rules.
  - Add **Prettier** for automated code formatting.
- **Testing Coverage**: Introduce **unit tests** to cover critical parts of the application, leveraging Jest for its simplicity and mocking capabilities.
- **Automated CI/CD**:
  - Use **GitHub Actions** to automate builds and test executions, ensuring a seamless integration pipeline.
- **Deployment Pipeline**:
  - Implement a robust deployment pipeline with **Docker** for containerization.
  - Use a cloud provider like **AWS** for scalable and reliable hosting.
- **Monitoring and Error Tracking**:
  - Add tools like **Sentry** or **LogRocket** for runtime error tracking and monitoring.
